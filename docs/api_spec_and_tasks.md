## Shared Knowledge

"""
The 'game.py' file contains the Game class, which is responsible for managing the game state, including the score and high score. It also handles starting, ending, and restarting the game. The Game class has a Snake instance and a Food instance.

The 'snake.py' file contains the Snake class, which is responsible for controlling the snake's movement, direction, and collision detection. It also handles eating the food and drawing the snake on the screen.

The 'food.py' file contains the Food class, which is responsible for managing the position of the food and generating new food when the snake eats it. It also handles drawing the food on the screen.

The 'main.py' file contains the main entry point for the game. It creates an instance of the Game class and starts the game loop.
