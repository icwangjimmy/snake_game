## Implementation approach

To implement the snake game, we will use the Pygame library, which is an open-source library specifically designed for game development in Python. Pygame provides a simple and intuitive API for handling graphics, sounds, and user input, making it a suitable choice for creating a snake game with smooth animations and intuitive controls.

## Python package name

snake_game

## File list

- main.py
- game.py
- snake.py
- food.py

## Data structures and interface definitions

classDiagram
    class Game {
        -int score
        -int high_score
        -Snake snake
        -Food food
        +__init__()
        +start_game()
        +end_game()
        +restart_game()
        +update_score()
        +draw_score()
    }

    class Snake {
        -List[Tuple[int, int]] body
        -Tuple[int, int] direction
        +__init__()
        +move()
        +change_direction()
        +eat_food()
        +check_collision()
        +draw()
    }

    class Food {
        -Tuple[int, int] position
        +__init__()
        +generate()
        +draw()
    }

    Game "1" -- "1" Snake: has
    Game "1" -- "1" Food: has


## Program call flow

sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant G as Game
    participant S as Snake
    participant F as Food

    M->>G: Create game instance
    G->>G: Initialize score and high score
    G->>S: Create snake instance
    G->>F: Create food instance
    G->>G: Start game
    G->>S: Move snake
    S->>S: Check collision
    S->>S: Change direction
    S->>S: Eat food
    G->>F: Generate new food
    G->>G: Update score
    G->>G: Draw score
    S->>S: Draw snake
    G->>G: End game
    G->>G: Restart game


## Anything UNCLEAR

The requirements are clear and there are no unclear points.
